Parser - Project 0 LyM

Hello, Here is the project for my parser. I apologise for speaking in English as I am an international student. 

The parser is coded in Python. 
To compile: 

- clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/MelisandeAllain/Project0-LyM.git

- unzip the file "parser" and open it in a Python compiler
 
- Open a terminal and go to the folder parser  >>cd parser

- execute the file main.py  >>python3 main.py

It will return the result of the parser for the text file \'91code.txt\'92 which corresponds to the correct code given in the guidelines of the project. To execute the parser on a different text file, just load the text file ( with extension .txt) to the folder parser, and add a line:

main(filename) 

at the end of the file main.py (line 93) and execute main.py

-The file test.py contains a succession of primary tests on all the different functions  implemented. It also loads the file \'91test.txt\'92 which is a code in the robot langage that I wrote to test different functions. All of the tests should return True.
